# Configuration Performance Learning
## Dataset details
This project contains datasets for nine widely studied configurable systems, each featuring different option types (e.g., integers, booleans, and enumerations), application domains, performance objectives, and programming languages.


## Code Implementation

This repository includes Python scripts for training and evaluating machine learning models to predict the performance of configurable systems based on their configuration options.

### Available Scripts

- **data_loader.py**: Utility for loading and processing datasets
  - Lists all available datasets
  - Loads specific datasets and splits them into training and testing sets

- **lr.py**: Linear Regression model implementation
  - Trains a linear regression model on configuration data
  - Evaluates model performance using multiple metrics

- **lightGBM.py**: Gradient Boosting model implementation
  - Trains a LightGBM model for more complex performance prediction
  - Generally provides higher accuracy than linear regression for non-linear relationships

### Performance Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Square root of the average squared differences
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Average percentage difference between predicted and actual values

### Usage

To train and evaluate a model on a specific dataset:

```bash
# Train a Linear Regression model on X264 dataset
python lr.py --dataset x264 --csv blue_sky_1080p25_short.y4m.csv --runs 30

# Train a LightGBM model on all X264 datasets
python lightGBM.py --dataset x264 --runs 30
```

Parameters:
- `--dataset`: Specifies the system directory (e.g., 'x264', 'kanzi')
- `--csv`: Optional. Specific CSV file to process (if omitted, processes all CSV files in the dataset)
- `--runs`: Number of experiment runs for statistical significance (default: 30)

Results are saved to the `log/YYYYMMDD/[model-type]/` directory with metrics and timestamps.

--

The dataset has nine folders, one for each system. Inside each folder, you'll find multiple CSV files, each recording configuration and performance data under a specific workload. Particularly:

- The first ***n-1* columns** represent the **configuration options**, and the **rightmost column** represents the **performance metric**;
- Each **row** corresponds to one **measurement sample** of configuration and performance.

Below is a detailed introduction to each system.
